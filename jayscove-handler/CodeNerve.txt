Heya There! My name is Jayden, also known as 'Jaymbermations' online. I am [â€¦] years old, and live in South Carolina.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>I am a micro content creator, wreaking havoc everywhere I go in my pursuit of claiming my odd and quite nonsensical corner of the internet, adn my own physical space, also kniwn as the horror that is my body.</p>
<p>....not literally, of course.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p> I have over 200+ subscribers, paired with my twitter, which is oh my god i am not saying what my twitter account is nor am i gonna link to it. Anyways, I love making videos, climbing places I shouldnt, exploring places I shouldnt, doing things I shouldnt, editing, coding (occasionally!), making merch cuz I'm broke, etc. You can find all of my links<a href="http://jayscove.com"> here</a>.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
