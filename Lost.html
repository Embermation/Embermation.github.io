<p><b>On November 30th, Robbie Binnicker, has made a response.</b></p><br>

<p>The following email reads:<br><br>
“Good morning students and thank you for your email.  As you are aware the Youtube shorts provide an unfiltered environment for students.  While there are many valuable Youtube videos, there are also many that are not appropriate for students in a school environment or on a school supplied device.<br>Unfortunately, there is no current solution to be able to appropriately filter Youtube shorts.  We either leave Youtube open and allow inappropriate access or close it.  <b>We are required by law to have a filtering process in place for students.  This is not happening for Youtube shorts and leaves us with the only option of closing Youtube.</b><br>The good news is that teachers will still be able to assign Youtube videos that students can access.  There should be no disruption in teachers being able to use Youtube and assign or allow access to certain Youtube videos for educational purposes.<br><br>We are hopeful that Google (who owns Youtube) will provide a solution soon that allows filtering software to filter shorts as well.  Until that time, the District really has no other choice. Thanks again for sharing your concerns. “
….Guess it’s time to globally wage war on Google and Alphabet (who owns Google). (Not really, I’m making a global petition.)</p>
