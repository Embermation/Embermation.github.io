		  <p>ughh.,,, it's 2:03 AM as of writing this on Jan 24.,,,, I just finished bugfixing, patching, creating, and coding everything for my site nonstop.,,,,,..... amazing ! yippee! [ that yippee and amazing has negative intonations behind them ].,,, Im gonna watch youtube and go commit die.,,,,, Jay out</p>
		<h2>Jan 25, 2:20 AM</h2>
		<p>ugh.,,,, i wrote another blog entry but it appears it wasnt saved.,,, so basically about 3, 4 hours ago i was talking with jack (is that their name?), percy/logan, brielle, and someone named Ace on discord, we talked for a long time, it was very joyous!</p>
                <p>So now I'm just listening to YouTube whiel,.., editing the blog, of course. There seems to be this disrupt that is def gonna be a problem at one point in time between friend groups so I'll try my best to explain it without 'exposing' anyone by just using their first initial.., YES THIS IS A VENT/RANT</p>
		<p>So, I have been friends with A and L for quite some time. A since 5th and L since 6th. Well, recently, I have become good friends (minus one cuz messy relationship) with L/P, B, and J. Now, apparently, these are the same kids that A and L told me were emo, lesbian (?), among other things, excluding L/P cuz like,.,.anyways</p>
		<p>So i engage with some conversation with B initially, and they get me hooked. I'm talking hook, line, sinker. They know about a lot of niche things that I also like (OMORI and thats actually probably iWAIT the verbalase video HAHAHAH), and they seem genuinely enjoyable and nothing at all like what A and L told me they were like,.</p>
		<p>Along with this, I also end up becoming friends with J (?) as well, which is a subsequent bonus. PLus, I need some biodiversity among who I'm friends with. Now, you can see where this is going. I'm friends with i guess you could call them the 'controversial' kids-- ough that doesnt feel good labeling them,..</p>
		<p>Anyways, I'm friends with the controversial kids and then the kids that hate the controversial kids.,... well not hate, but just genuienly dislike,.,.... AND HEY B SAID SHE LIKED MY THIGH HIGHS (i am nOT elaborating).</p>
                <p>okay rant over.,.... you are dismissed you have a quiz on how messed up my mental state is next period now scram like the things you are .,!!</p>
