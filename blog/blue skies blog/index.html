		  <p>ughh.,,, it's 2:03 AM as of writing this on Jan 24.,,,, I just finished bugfixing, patching, creating, and coding everything for my site nonstop.,,,,,..... amazing ! yippee! [ that yippee and amazing has negative intonations behind them ].,,, Im gonna watch youtube and go commit die.,,,,, Jay out</p>
		
		<h2>Jan 25, 2:20 AM</h2>
		
		<p>ugh.,,,, i wrote another blog entry but it appears it wasnt saved.,,, so basically about 3, 4 hours ago i was talking with jack (is that their name?), percy/logan, brielle, and someone named Ace on discord, we talked for a long time, it was very joyous!</p>
		
                <p>So now I'm just listening to YouTube whiel,.., editing the blog, of course. There seems to be this disrupt that is def gonna be a problem at one point in time between friend groups so I'll try my best to explain it without 'exposing' anyone by just using their first initial.., YES THIS IS A VENT/RANT</p>
		
		<p>So, I have been friends with A and L for quite some time. A since 5th and L since 6th. Well, recently, I have become good friends (minus one cuz messy relationship) with L/P, B, and J. Now, apparently, these are the same kids that A and L told me were emo, lesbian (?), among other things, excluding L/P cuz like,.,.anyways</p>
		
		<p>So i engage with some conversation with B initially, and they get me hooked. I'm talking hook, line, sinker. They know about a lot of niche things that I also like (OMORI and thats actually probably iWAIT the verbalase video HAHAHAH), and they seem genuinely enjoyable and nothing at all like what A and L told me they were like,.</p>
		
		<p>Along with this, I also end up becoming friends with J (?) as well, which is a subsequent bonus. PLus, I need some biodiversity among who I'm friends with. Now, you can see where this is going. I'm friends with i guess you could call them the 'controversial' kids-- ough that doesnt feel good labeling them,..</p>
		
		<p>Anyways, I'm friends with the controversial kids and then the kids that hate the controversial kids.,... well not hate, but just genuienly dislike,.,.... AND HEY B SAID SHE LIKED MY THIGH HIGHS (i am nOT elaborating).</p>
		
                <p>okay rant over.,.... you are dismissed you have a quiz on how messed up my mental state is next period now scram like the things you are .,!!</p>
		
		<h2>11:15 PM</h2>
		
		<p>So.... its been a bit. Anywaysz, my presentation fone well, then I had a heart attack cuz inwas called for the office.,,, and my blog entires havent been saving which is fucked up.,,, dobt really kniw what to talk about. Day felt boring... i feel empty</p>


		<h2>Jan 27, 7:00 AM</h2>

		<p>Okay, yesterday I didn't go to school which was great, BUT that means I have ISS for Monday and Tuesday.,.,.... and that sucks. ON TOP OF THAT, approx. 20 minutes before writing this, I overheard 
		my  m o t h e r, while I was 'alseep', that the only resolution she made to the school was to have my school ipad taken everytime i leave,..,. what shit is this????</p>

		<p>this isnt fair,.., they're treating me liek i'm some sort of,.... villian, criminal. some sort of degranged netizen who,.. idk what they're scared of. they're scared of me doing something. 
		otherwise they would just take my ipad out right..,,,m whatever. Anyways, I created a tiny pythonscript that, because my ouse pad is broken, replaces the functinality of the arrow keys</p>

		<p>and uses it to move the mouse around,... it replaces the ` key and the = key as left and right click respectively.,,.,.. it DOES work,. but it doesn't draw the mouse cursor sprite to the 
		screen,... I'll figure out how to do that,.. also, I'm gonna create a script that updates the <a href="http://jayscove.com" target=_blank">main page's nihilistic quote</a> with something</p>

		<p>different every single time the page is refreshed,.., let's hope it works. I'll check in whenever I do that... alr, Jayden out for now !!</p>

		<h2>10:00 PM</h2>

		<p>So... been a bit. Just got done doing basically all of the chores in the house. That took a while. Other than that, I spent an hour editing my EFI file on my computer so the windows boot image is replaced with... certain... images. Yes, imageS, plural, cuz it changes every single time on boot.</p>

		<p>I would provide examples, but the pictures have me in them. ANd.. I haven't publicly posted my entire face online yet (At least, of my own knowing voliotion). I honestly have been neglecting the group of schizos on discord...,, Sorry about that, hehe...,,, (That 'hehe' had a sorry intonation behind it.)</p>

	<p>I'm taking a break from like,.,.,... All social media except for texting (discord). I've decided I'm gonna go on hiatus for my YT channel..,, let's hope this doesnt bite me in the ass later.,.</p>

	<h2>Jan 29, 2:54 AM</h2>

<p>OKay so,... I might try to sneak to the cafeteria at my school during dismissal cuz.,, I kinda have ISS you know,.. and I don't know if I'm gonna be able to uhh...... go to the cafeteria... IT'S ALMOST THREE?? DAMN??? It's the demon hour,.. im gonna go around and haunt people,.,.,.., Okay so I wanted to, at the cafeteria, take a picture of the friend group i recvently assimilated to but,.. MY CAMERA IS DEAD.. i wanna add them to the amalgamation of fnnny little photos like BASIL'S PHOTO ALBUM,. Wait let me try to fix the polaroid,.....</p>

<h2>3:09 AM</h2>

<p>Okay the camera does NOT work,... I mean-- it works, it works but i mean its., nevermind. YO IMAGINE LIKE yoyu come from from school, hop on discord.... and some person just texts you their shooping list they're like.,,<br><br>1. 1 doz eggs.<br>2. milk<br>3. tomatoes (6 pk)<br>4. bannana (man[/ref])<br>5.<br>6. skinwalker</p>

<p>I think i'm going delulu I NEED AND CRAVE AND I'D KILL FOR PHYSICAL CONTACT OR ANY SORT OF CONTACT RN !!!!,.. ugh..
